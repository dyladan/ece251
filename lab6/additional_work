1.) The program counter points to the next instruction to be executed.
2.) Before JSR is executed the program counter points to it at $1263
3.) After JSR is executed the program counter points to $126F
4.) The return address is the last thing on the stack with the high half of the 16 bit value as the top item
5.) The difference between JSR and BRA is that BRA does not save a return address on the stack.
